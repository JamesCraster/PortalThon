BUGS:

player sometimes is not exactly on a tile at the bottom/bottom right of the screen. FIXED: play space wasn't of form 16m * 16n
have to leave one dark frame before scoretext is defined and appears


Features:

make top bar around scoreText so that player cannot overun it
make pool resizeable in the event the pool is not large enough
make pellet spawn randomly in play area(define 'play area' rigorously)
